# React Native Dimensions.get('window') Returns Incorrect Height on Android

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native on Android. The problem is that `Dimensions.get('window').height` sometimes returns 0 or an inaccurate height value, leading to layout problems and rendering inconsistencies.

## Problem

The `Dimensions` API, intended to provide accurate screen dimensions, can return incorrect height measurements, especially on Android. This is likely due to asynchronous loading or timing differences in how the native modules provide these dimensions to React Native. 

## Solution

The provided solution illustrates how to handle this issue effectively. It involves using the `useEffect` hook to ensure the dimensions are obtained after the component has mounted and potentially after the layout has been calculated, using `Dimensions.addEventListener` to listen for dimension changes, ensuring the accuracy of the data. The app will correctly render across different screen sizes and orientations using the adjusted logic.
